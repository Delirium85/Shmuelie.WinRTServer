# What is it?

The Component Object Model (COM) API that underlines .NET and the Windows
Runtime supports the concept of "Out Of Process Servers". This allows for using
objects that are in a different process (or even a different machine) as though
they were in the local process. This library adds APIs to make the process of
using this in .NET much easier.

> **Note**: COM and Windows Runtime are Windows only.
